# DiceZone for command-line. ðŸŽ²

## About

* * *

Dice are small, throwable objects with marked sides
that can rest in multiple positions. They are used
for generating random numbers, commonly as part of
tabletop games, including dice games, board games,
role-playing games, and games of chance.

DiceZone is a dice rolling simulator application that
really puts you in the zone. Gain the ability to roll
dice from within the command-line.

## Tooling information

* * *

Targeted audience we are building for is MacOSX and Linux users. This project uses
[Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) `0.56.0` and newer.

## Setup, Compile and Install

* * *

Firstly the users should set up a project build directory before
compiling:

```console
meson setup builddir
```

The next step should be to compile the target of a configured
Meson project:

```console
meson compile -C builddir
```

Then we install the application like so:

```console
meson install -C builddir
```

And finally we run this cool application:

```console
dice-zone
```
